# liquid-web

This is a strange mutation of the [liquid-ios repo](https://github.com/liquidvote/liquid-ios), built for the web thanks to [`react-native-web`](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).

## Install

Download the repo (fork if you may send PRs).

Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to download the dependencies.

## Development

Run `npm start` to start the webpack server. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

If testing locally on a mobile device using your local network, you can pass your dev machine's IP address as a command line option to npm start with: `npm start -- --public <your computers IP>"`

#### Linting
This project has strict eslint rules. Run `npm test` to check for linting.
